## Debug

- Error: ENFILE: file table overflow
    - Reason: MAC default setting too low.
    - Solutionï¼š`sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=65536`, `sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=65536`
- Error: replacement transaction underpriced
    - Reason: Send too fast, so nonce repeat.
    - Solution1: Now temporarily use the queue to process transactions
    - Solution2: Try to change to batch transactions in the future

- Error: out of gas
    - Reason: quorum([ref](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum/issues/1081))
    - Solution: Specify a high gaslimit`send({from: ADDRESS , gas: GASLIMIT}`)
